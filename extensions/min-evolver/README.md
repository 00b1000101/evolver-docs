# min-eVOLVER

## About

The min-eVOLVER is a minimal, mini version of the main eVOLVER. It runs in the same software ecosystem with minimal changes to the code. However, the min-eVOLVER only controls two vials and six pumps, making it simpler, smaller, and less costly.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Currently the min-eVOLVER does not use the eVOLVER GUI. All experiments must be started with the command line.
