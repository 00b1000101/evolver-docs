# Custom Experiments

Rather than propose a single continuous culture device designed to a specific purpose, our goal with eVOLVER was to demonstrate a design framework that gives the user the freedom to imagine and carry out virtually any type of experiment that uses automated cell growth functionality to study cellular fitness. Here, we comment on reconfiguring eVOLVER for several experiments of significant interest in the community. For further examples, see Supplementary Table 1.
