## Vials

OD is dependent on depth of LED in vial

* Characterized on this forum post
* Needs to be pushed to users

OD is dependent on vial position

* Notched vial caps help align
* Brandon has designed vial aligners
* It is generally an unwritten rule to not move vials after experiment start, but this is sometimes impossible

Stirring affects OD

* Tuning stirring too high can cause stir bars to chitter (stop turning and move around)
* Because the stirred media forms a spout in the middle
* Therefore inconsistent stirring can means more noise in OD reading
* Also, less stirring = less optimal growth

## Fluidics

Pump heads stop working

* Causes overflows, poor reliability
* Fixed by new pumps
* Almost all evolvers have old pumps

## eVOLVER Base

New eVOLVER base susceptible to fluid damage

* Vial overflows or spills get into chassis via ribbon cable ports, then short motherboard
* Drainage system drips down the back of the eV and into chassis
* Overflows finally leak onto bench and floor requiring serious cleanup

Old eVOLVER base susceptible to fluid damage

* Fluids from vials drip onto pumps, destroying them
