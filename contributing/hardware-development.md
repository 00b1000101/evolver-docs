# Hardware Development

## Design Ethos

eVOLVER Hardware strives to be:

1. Modular
2. Extensible
3. Programmable
4. Robust
5. Affordable
6. Accessible (easily sourced parts, open source designs and information)

## Steps

1. Make an issue on the hardware [GitHub](https://github.com/FYNCH-BIO/hardware)
2. Characterize the problem on the [forum](documentation/making-a-forum-post.md)
3. Make changes and add to your forum post
4. Make a pull request on [GitHub](hardware-development.md#hardware-github-contribution-guide)

## Hardware GitHub Contribution Guide

Once the new hardware has been tested by the community, follow the guide for contributing to GitHub as outlined on the [software page](software-development.md).

CAD file contributions should be uploaded in the following formats:

1. .sldprt or .f3d - Solidworks or Fusion360 Archive files. These contain the design history of the part, making future editing much easier.&#x20;
2. .step or .stp files to support editing via any common CAD tool
3. .stl file for 3D printing and model viewing.
