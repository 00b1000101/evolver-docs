# Reporting a Bug / Hardware Failure

## Is it a bug / failure?

Examples of things that aren't considered bugs / hardware failures:

* Can't figure out how to do something
* Having issues installing software or setting up eVOLVER
* My experiment failed
* I want the eVOLVER to do something different (If you have a new feature request please post on the [forums](https://www.evolver.bio/))

If your issue falls into one of these categories, please use the [troubleshooting documentation](../troubleshooting/troubleshooting-overview.md) or ask on the forums

## Before reporting a new issue

1. Carefully read the documentation for the affected part.
2. Use the [troubleshooting ](../troubleshooting/troubleshooting-overview.md)documentation
3. Software - Make sure you are running the latest versions of the GUI and DPU
4. Try to narrow it down to reproducible steps. If we can reproduce it, we will be able to fix the issue faster.
5. Check the known issues pages for [hardware](../hardware/known-issues.md) and [software](../software/known-issues.md), also check issues for software on GitHub
   1. Should your bug be described there, comment on the issue that you are also experiencing it
   2. Add additional information if you can
6. Search the [forums](https://www.evolver.bio/) using a few different search terms.
7. If you got this far, then report an issue.

## Reporting a new issue

1. Make an issue on the relevant [software](../software/overview-of-software-architecture.md) GitHub or the [hardware ](https://github.com/FYNCH-BIO/hardware)GitHub
2. Characterize the problem in a [forum post](documentation/making-a-forum-post.md)
3. If this bug / failure is detrimental to you, please consider developing a solution
