Log in to router and make it have a static IP

otherwise IP will change each time it's power cycled

Then when connecting via ssh it will warn you and you need to change the file

You can then change the name, MAC address, and IP of the evolver in the evolver-config.json file

Router IP: 192.168.1.1

Login: admin

pw: password
