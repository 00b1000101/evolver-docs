# Calibrations

In order to appropriately interpret data from and actuate physical elements connected to the eVOLVER framework, a relationship must be established between the electrical signals generated by attached sensors and the physical phenomenon they are measuring. This is done by manually measuring values on a controlled set of data via some gold-standard assay or measurement device and comparing these data to the eVOLVER generated data. By doing this across a range of different values, a function can be fit to this relationship to allow eVOLVER to interpret data accurately.
