# Preparing Vials

{% hint style="warning" %}
[Construct, print, or source](../../getting-started/part-sourcing.md#vial-caps) vials caps before starting this protocol
{% endhint %}

## Protocol

{% hint style="info" %}
Make 1-2 extra vials, in case you find an issue after autoclaving. If using septa, it may be best to make 4-5 extra as many septa will be pulled inside of vial by autoclave pressures.
{% endhint %}

1. Rinse vial lids by running DI water from sink through influx and efflux straws (2-3 seconds). Alternatively fill a large beaker with DI water, dump vial lids in and stir.&#x20;
2. Shake vials caps to remove excess water and set aside on a clean surface
3. Get out enough dishwashed vials (stored upside down), place in white rack
4. Place a small stirbar in each vial
5. If using septa, place a septa on each
6. Screw on rinsed vial lids
7. If vials will be used within 24 hours of prepping, then place white rack in small autoclave bin, cover entire bin with foil (reuse foil if possible), and autoclave on vacuum cycle for 10 minutes
8. Keep foil on bin until right before loading vials into eVOLVER to maintain sterility
9. If vials are being prepped in advance, screw a white or black mini-cap onto every straw, then autoclave in bin without foil
10. Keep mini-caps on until right before loading vials into eVOLVER to maintain sterility
