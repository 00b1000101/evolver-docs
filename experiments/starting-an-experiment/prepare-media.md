# Prepare Media

## Media Requirements

A primary consideration when running eVOLVER experiments is predicting the media consumption rate, which is typically orders of magnitude higher than in typical batch experiments. The required media for continuous culture can be estimated using the following equation: 𝑀𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑎 𝑅𝑒𝑞𝑢𝑖𝑟𝑒𝑑 \[𝑚𝐿] = 𝐶𝑢𝑙𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑒 𝑉𝑜𝑙𝑢𝑚𝑒 \[𝑚𝐿] / 𝐴𝑣𝑔. 𝐷𝑜𝑢𝑏𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑇𝑖𝑚𝑒 \[ℎ] ∗ 𝑁𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟 𝑜𝑓𝐶𝑢𝑙𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑒𝑠 ∗ 𝐷𝑢𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 \[ℎ] (1) It should be noted that additional media (\~20mL) is needed during device setup to flush media input lines.

## 20L Carboy Preparation

1. Use media calculator (link to sheet?) to determine amount of media needed
2. Insert guide to making 20L carboy here
3. Steam clean 20L carboy
4. Rinse carboy with water
5. Fill 10% with DI water
6. Autoclave on liquids cycle
7. Pour out DI water
8. Mark as steam cleaned with date and name
9. Measure media into carboy
10. Mix by shaking carboy (get a friend if needed)
11. Cover carboy ports with foil
12. Prevents contamination
13. Autoclave
14. Get a friend to help with loading / unloading!
15. Liquids cycle
16. Streilizing time X minutes
17. Cool media
18. At least to temperature of cell culture
19. Can simply wait or can also put carboy in ice bath for faster cooling
