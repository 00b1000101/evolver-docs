# Part Sourcing

## Guidelines

1. Use the below Google Sheet to source parts for each of the eVOLVER subsystems (click on the tabs for different parts of the eVOLVER)&#x20;
2. Parts may not be available due to backorder, discontinuation, or regional differences
3. If you are able to find an alternative vendor for a part, please post to the forum so it can be added to the spreadsheet
4. Should you not be able to order a part, post to the forum \<link part sourcing forum post>

## eVOLVER Specific Parts

Many eVOLVER parts must be 3D printed or are custom PCBs made to control eVOLVER hardware. For these, please see the [hardware GitHub](https://github.com/FYNCH-BIO/hardware) for CAD files and electronics parts lists for eVOLVER PCBs.
