# Millifluidics Guides

{% hint style="info" %}
This is a page collecting guides for millifluidics. These do not come with the base eVOLVER and thus should done only by advanced users.

For documentation and information about millifluidics see the [hardware page](../../hardware/overview-of-millifluidics/).

Nature Biotech, 2018</em> - Millifluidic multiplexing devices enable novel, customized liquid routing. Devices are fabricated by bonding a silicone membrane between two plastic layers with laser-etched flow channels. Integrated pneumatic valves actuate on the membrane to direct fluidic routing from media input to output ports (to or from vials).</p></figcaption></figure>
