# Designing Millifluidics Using Eagle

### Design

Eagle

* Using Eagle to drag and drop elements + make layers
* Problem with Eagle
*
  * Only outputs dxf
  * We then have to trace as a png in illustrator
  * This creates a double line
  * Less accurate + goes over each area twice

Zack defines width of the pumps, but doesn't worry about depth

&#x20;

Width of channel / valves

* Too small = hard to align + valves will no longer stay closed
* Larger is more robust

&#x20;

Barb spacing

* Want enough space between each barb for tool
* Far enough from the edge
*
  * Prevent leaking from the port
