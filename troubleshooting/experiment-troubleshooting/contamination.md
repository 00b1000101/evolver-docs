# Contamination

While batch culture techniques often utilize biosafety hoods or flame convection currents to keep workspaces sterile, these are rarely amenable for automated cell culture devices. Prevention of contamination in eVOLVER is achieved at three levels: 1) sterilization of media, culture vessels, and fluidic lines, 2) attention to sterile technique, and 3) physical and chemical barriers to contaminants. First, all media bottles and their adapters, and all components of the culture vessel (e.g. borosilicate glass vial, magnetic stir bar, cap with fluidic adapters) are designed to be autoclaved before each use. Fluidic lines on the device are sterilized before and after each experiment using bleach and ethanol (see Online Methods). Second, following sterilization, sterile technique should be practiced when attaching media lines to culture vials by working quickly, avoiding physical contact with the ends of fluidics lines, and taking care to spray gloves with ethanol. Finally, additional physical and chemical measures may be taken depending on the organism and experiment. For example, the sampling port may be covered by a sterile membrane for long-term culture. For slow-growing eukaryotic cultures, antibiotics can be added to the media to exclude bacterial contaminants. UV sterilization of components or surfaces is another preventative measure to consider.
